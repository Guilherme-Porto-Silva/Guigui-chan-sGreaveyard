                To enter this level, you need to find a graveyard in a city themed level, wich must not have been built by humans who entered sad city themed level, and perform a ritual there, one of those rituals people perform in the Frontrooms to guide or summon ghosts. The performed ritual needs to be not recomended, so one with intention of triggering not deserved suffering or to seal pacts with dangerus ghosts. Once the ritual is done, evryone who willingly participated or had the wish to participate is falling trough the floor of the graveyard found in a city themed level and comming out of the floor of a graveyard found in level Liminal Tombstones. To leave, there is a list of ways.
